# Electric-Upright-Bass

In my Project 1 class, I have designed and built an electric double bass. The following steps were implemented: design, material selection, stress testing, materials & components acquisition, final assembly & presentation.

 - In this project I constructed the main body using an aluminum bar & wood for the neck for easy and cheap assembly. 
 - All string mounts were 3D printed and reinforced from carbon nanotube enforced plastic, with metal mounting points.
 - The strings were bought externally.
 - The control panel was designed in DipTrace and then assembled using 3D printed parts.
 - The coils were wound using a simple Arduino code that countet the number of rotations using a Hall Effect sensor.

Main issues encountered with the project and lessons learned:

 - While the string tension was taken into account for the designing the mounts, I did not take into account the orientation of print layers and they proved to be a critical failing point. Last minute modifications using small steel plates were made to reinforce the 3D printer parts.
 - The bass neck carving process took more time than expected and required overtime work to finish the project on time.
