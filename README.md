# Electric-Upright-Bass

In my Project 1 class, I have designed and built an electric double bass. The following steps were implemented: design, stress testing, materials & components acquisition, final assembly & presentation.

In this project I constructed the main body using an aluminum bar & wood for the neck. All string mounts were 3D printed and reinforced with metal pieces. The strings themselves were bought externally, however I did design and wind the coils.
